				<h3>Ways to Help!</h3>
				<p>Purrfect Kitties is built off of community support!<br>
				We make this possible by helpful humans like you who donate time, money and supplies to our nonprofit organization!<br>
				Without your help, we would no longer be able to provide this awesome service to the public in the North Metropolitan Area.<br>
				<br>
				If you would like to help supply us with the necessary food and shelters for our cats, we're always accepting donations to the cause!<br>
				To get in contact with us about donating supplies, time, or other resources, please feel free to contact us on our
				<a href="contact-us.html">Contact Page</a>.
