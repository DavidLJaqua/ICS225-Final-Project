		<h3>Kitten Fostering</h3>
		<p>Kitten and cat fostering is the next best thing to actually owning a kitten yourself!</p>
		
		<h4>What does it mean to foster an animal?</h4>
		<p>An animal foster is a person or family that provides a temporary home for a rescued pet until it is adopted. 
		Many homeless dogs and cats grew up in homes where they were well-loved. But, for whatever reason, they have found themselves
		homeless, scared and alone. A foster home provides a loving environment which helps relieve the animal's stress while they 
		wait for a new, permanent home.</p>
		
		<h4>What do foster parents do?</h4>
		<p>The responsibilities of an animal foster are similar to those of being an actual parent. A foster provides a safe environment 
		and appropriate food, teaches good manners and sets aside time each day for socialization, play, and exercise. A foster parent 
		may also be asked to bring their foster animal to the vet for worming, vaccinations or other health checks.</p>
		
		<h4>What does it cost to foster an animal?</h4>
		<p>There is no cost to foster a homeless pet. We provide all necessary supplies; food, leashes, kennels, kitty litter, 
		grooming supplies, etc. All veterinary care is also paid for by us, our donors, and supporters. </p>
		
		<h4>How do I become an animal foster?</h4>
		<p>To become a foster for Purrfect Kittens, you must be at least 21 years old. If you live with adult friends or family members, 
		you must have approval from everyone in the household to become a foster.<br>
		<br>
		Your first step is to complete a volunteer application which can be retrieved by requesting one via the <a href="contact-us.html">Contact Page</a>. 
		The application can be completed online or printed and mailed to us. After your application is reviewed you will go through a short telephone interview 
		process. A home visit will be conducted before, and occassionally during fostering.</p>
